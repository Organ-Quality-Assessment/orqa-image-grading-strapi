## Built With

[Strapi](https://strapi.io/)  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Requires Node.js (v14, v16 or v18) and npm (v6 only) or yarn. Requires a database (MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL or SQLite). 

If using MySQL, the user Strapi uses must use the authentication plugin `mysql_native_password` (rather than the newer `caching_sha2_password`). You can check what plugin is in use byb running this SQL command (where root is the username):

SELECT user, plugin FROM mysql.user WHERE user IN ('root');

If you need to change the authentication plugin used (where username is root and password is admin):

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'admin';

### Installation

```
yarn add strapi
```

### Running Locally

 `develop`

Start your Strapi application with autoReload enabled. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-develop)

```
npm run develop
# or
yarn develop
```

`start`

Start your Strapi application with autoReload disabled. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-start)

```
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

 `build`

Build your admin panel. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-build)

```
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

### Running Tests

How to run tests on your local system.

## Deployment

### Local

Deploying to a production style setup but on the local system. Examples of this would include `venv`, `anaconda`, `Docker` or `minikube`. 

### Production

Deploying to the production system. Examples of this would include cloud, HPC or virtual machine. 


To connect to the mySQL database in oracle, you need to first ssh into a compute instance (https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/accessinginstance.htm). You will then need to install mysql (https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/mysql-database/doc/compute-instance.html#GUID-70023ABD-5418-4C1F-975F-F3E2ABC0F93E). 
sudo yum install mysql-shell

Connect to mysql

mysqlsh orqadmin@10.0.1.45

To create a new user:
\sql CREATE USER ‘nativeuser’@’localhost’IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY ‘password’

new user called orqauser

## Usage

Any links to production environment, video demos and screenshots.

## Contributing

### Main Branch
Protected and can only be pushed to via pull requests. Should be considered stable and a representation of production code.

### Dev Branch
Should be considered fragile, code should compile and run but features may be prone to errors.

### Feature Branches
A branch per feature being worked on.
